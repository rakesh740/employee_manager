# Employee Manager

Problem Description:

You are tasked with creating a Go application that manages a simple employee database or in-memory store. Additionally, you need to implement a RESTful API with pagination for listing employee records.

Requirements:

1. Employee Struct:

    - Define a struct named `Employee` with the following fields:

    - `ID` (int): Unique identifier for the employee.

    - `Name` (string): Name of the employee.

    - `Position` (string): Position/title of the employee.

    - `Salary` (float64): Salary of the employee.

2. CRUD Operations:

    - Implement functions/methods to perform CRUD operations on the employee database or in-memory store:

    - `CreateEmployee`: Adds a new employee to the database or store.

    - `GetEmployeeByID`: Retrieves an employee from the database or store by ID.

    - `UpdateEmployee`: Updates the details of an existing employee.

    - `DeleteEmployee`: Deletes an employee from the database or store by ID.

3. Concurrency:

    - Ensure that the application is safe for concurrent use by using appropriate synchronization mechanisms.

4. Testing:

    - Write unit tests to cover the CRUD operations and ensure the correctness of the implementation.

5. RESTful API with Pagination:

    - Implement a RESTful API for listing employee records with pagination.

    - The API should provide endpoints for listing employees with support for pagination.

    - Each page should contain a configurable number of records.

    - Implement proper error handling and response formatting for the API endpoints.

    -Evaluation Criteria:

    - Accuracy and completeness of implementation of all requirements.

    - Proper usage of Go concurrency primitives for safe concurrent access.

    - Adequate test coverage and correctness of unit tests.

    - Efficiency and performance of CRUD operations.

    - Correct implementation of the RESTful API with pagination.

    - Clarity, readability, and organization of code.

Submission:

Candidates are required to complete the quiz by coding the solution in Go and providing the code in a GitHub repository or any other preferred version control system. Additionally, candidates should include:

- A video demonstration showcasing the functionality of the application, including CRUD operations and API testing using tools like Postman. (Good to have)
